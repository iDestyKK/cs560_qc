# cs560\_qc (Spring 2019)

## Synopsis
Nothing much to say at the moment.

## Project Progress
Project directories are labelled by semester and project number. They have the following format:
```
semester_number_name
```
For example, a project from Spring 2019 would be something like `sp19_01_http_server`.

### Spring 2019
```diff
+ 1 - HTTP Webserver (http_server)
+ 2 - Hadoop back-end for looking up words in huge files (inverted_indexer)
- 3 - Performance comparison between various K-V storage software (query_compare - WIP)
```

### Spring 2018
These are other projects that I anticipated would be going on in this semester.
Unfortunately they were changed. But I'll keep the code here for archival.
```diff
+ 1 - File System (cn_fs)
```
