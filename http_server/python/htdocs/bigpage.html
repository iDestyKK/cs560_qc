		<h3>Including all available C++ and C headers.</h3>
		<p>
			Let's look at the following code:
			<pre><code>#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
	printf("%d\n", 1337);
}</code></pre>
			This code is pretty special. First off, <code>bits/stdc++.h</code> includes all possible headers. It's for the lazy people.

			Did you know that this is incredibly useless? Include whatever and don't make that poor compiler do the hard work... you meanie.
